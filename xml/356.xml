<topHtml secId="3" spotId="1">&lt;B class="largeviolet"&gt;Y&lt;/B&gt;our doctor understands that all medical care benefits from close collaboration between physician and patient -- so be sure to review, with your doctor, all risks and alternatives and make sure you understand the reasons behind the recommendation for this particular procedure.
&lt;p&gt; Now let's talk in detail about the procedure your doctor has recommended. That particular recommendation was based on a number of factors: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;B&gt; &lt;li class="medviolet"&gt;the state of your health, &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/B&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;B&gt; &lt;li class="medviolet"&gt; an assessment of alternative treatments or procedures and finally, &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/B&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;B&gt; &lt;li class="medviolet"&gt; the risks associated with doing nothing at all. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/B&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; And remember, the final decision is up to you. No one can force you to undergo a surgical procedure against your will. &lt;/p&gt;

<topHtml secId="4" spotId="1">&lt;B class="largeviolet"&gt;O&lt;/B&gt;ver the course of the procedure, you'll be under the care of one or more nurses. Our job is to provide for your care and comfort - before, during and after surgery.
&lt;p&gt; On the day of surgery, it's important that you tell us how you're feeling. And we certainly want you and your family to feel completely free to ask us any questions at any time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Before the operation, your doctors will examine your medical history as well as your current physical condition. This is an important step because the results of that exam will help your medical team to make decisions about your care. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; So remember, it is very important that you give your doctor your complete medical history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Be sure to remember to &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;B&gt; &lt;li class="medred"&gt; report previous illnesses, &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/B&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;B&gt; &lt;li class="medred"&gt; previous surgeries, &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/B&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;B&gt; &lt;li class="medred"&gt; prescription or over-the-counter, &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/B&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

<!-- ANA Header ALL //-->
<topHtml secId="5" spotId="1">&lt;B class="largeviolet"&gt;M&lt;/B&gt;ost people understand that anesthesia is used to block the perception of pain - but anesthesia plays another, equally important role as well. Let me explain.
&lt;p&gt; Anesthesia allows your surgical team to control - and to monitor - a wide range of natural physiological reflexes. As you know, all surgery involves cutting small amounts of skin or other tissue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Your mind certainly knows the difference between a surgical incision and, for example, and an accidental cut. The problem is, that your body doesn't understand this difference. In fact, your body reacts pretty dramatically to anything it perceives to be a threat to your well-being. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Without anesthesia, a surgical incision would cause not only pain, but an increase in heart rate, changes in blood pressure and a whole host of other reflexive defense mechanisms which our bodies rely on for protection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; So it's important to realize that anesthesia is meant to calm and relax the mind and body in a general sense - not only to block pain but to control those natural defenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; It's for that reason that the anesthesia you receive will probably include a sedative - either to relax you or to put you to sleep altogether. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Today, surgeons and anesthesiologists have a wide range of options for keeping you comfortable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Pain is an alarm signal sensed by nerves and sent to the brain where it's interpreted and felt. All types of anesthesia work by interfering with the transmission or interpretation of that signal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;</topHtml>

<botHtml secId="x">Why would your doctor recommend or choose one kind of anesthesia over another? It's a decision based on comfort, precisely where on your body your surgery will take place and your overall physical condition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; This procedure is usually considered to be a simple operation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In unusual cases, a patient may be given general anesthesia - in other words, you might be put to sleep. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; But most often, your doctor will simply administer a local anesthetic ... with one or more injections of an anesthetic drug directly into the tissue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The advantage of this kind anesthetic is that it allows you to remain awake, it has less impact on you and your body than general anesthesia does and you recover from it much more quickly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; If you've ever experienced any allergic reaction to anesthesia or to any other substance, be sure to let your surgeon or anesthesiologist know well beforehand. &lt;/p&gt;</botHtml>

&lt;p&gt; This particular surgical technique offers the surgeon a wide selection of anesthesia options. The particular anesthesia chosen will depend on personal preference -- both yours and your doctor's. In some cases, patients are given general anesthesia -- in other words, you might be put to sleep. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; But most often, your doctor and anesthesiologist will administer a local anesthetic, either by injecting an anesthetic drug directly around the operative field so that all the tissue layers are numb &lt;/p&gt;

<botHtml secId="x">&lt;p&gt; A spinal is still considered to be a kind of local anesthesia in that you remain awake during surgery. It's extremely effective, but takes a little longer to wear off than does a more localized anesthesia. &lt;/p&gt;

<topHtml secId="6" spotId="1">&lt;B class="largeviolet"&gt;B&lt;/B&gt;ecause you've been scheduled for ambulatory - or outpatient surgery - you're responsible for taking certain precautions before you arrive. Specifically...
&lt;p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;B&gt; &lt;li class="medred"&gt; You must not have anything to eat or drink after midnight on the night before you arrive at the hospital. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/B&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;B&gt; &lt;li class="medred"&gt; Do not take any aspirin or other anti-inflammatory for 10 days before surgery. Occasionally these drugs can interfere with the blood's ability to clot and can actually increase the amount of bleeding during and after surgery. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/B&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;B&gt; &lt;li class="medred"&gt; If you're on any medication - including over the counter drugs - be sure to ask your doctor whether or not you can continue taking that medication. And if not, how far in advance of surgery you must stop. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/B&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;B&gt; &lt;li class="medred"&gt; Finally, you must also arrange for transportation to and from the place at which the procedure will be performed. Everyone reacts differently to even simple surgical procedures and there's no way you can predict how you'll be feeling after the procedure. So don't forget, following surgery, you will not be allowed to drive. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/B&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;B&gt; &lt;li class="medred"&gt; Finally, you must be prepared to spend one or more nights in the hospital. That means bringing a bag packed with the kind of essential clothing and toiletries you feel you'll need for a period of bed rest. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/B&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;B&gt; &lt;li class="medred"&gt; It's important that you not make any plans for activities in the days following surgery. After your time in the hospital, you will spend even more time recovering at home. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/B&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;B&gt; &lt;li class="medred"&gt; And it's impossible to predict with 100% certainty how long you'll be in the hospital or how long you'll have to take it easy at home. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/B&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;B&gt; &lt;li class="medred"&gt; Everyone reacts differently to even simple surgical procedures and there's no way you can predict how you'll be feeling after the procedure. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/B&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The nurse and anesthesiologist will be closely monitoring your comfort and progress. Remember, don't hesitate to ask any questions about any of the information that they've just provided. &lt;/p&gt;</topHtml>

<topHtml secId="x" spotId="x">&lt;B class="largeviolet"&gt;B&lt;/B&gt;ecause you've been scheduled for ambulatory - or outpatient surgery - you're responsible for taking certain precautions before you arrive. Specifically...
&lt;p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;B&gt; &lt;li class="medred"&gt; You must not have anything to eat or drink after midnight on the night before you arrive at the hospital. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/B&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;B&gt; &lt;li class="medred"&gt; If you're on any medication - including over the counter drugs - be sure to ask your doctor whether or not you can continue taking that medication. And if not, how far in advance of surgery you must stop. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/B&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;B&gt; &lt;li class="medred"&gt; Finally, you must also arrange for transportation to and from the place at which the procedure will be performed. Everyone reacts differently to even simple surgical procedures and there's no way you can predict how you'll be feeling after the procedure. So don't forget, following surgery, you will not be allowed to drive. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/B&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The nurse and anesthesiologist will be closely monitoring your comfort and progress. Remember, don't hesitate to ask any questions about any of the information that they've just provided. &lt;/p&gt;</topHtml>

Plan on spending several hours in recovery. Your doctor may be able to give you a more precise estimate prior to surgery.
&lt;p&gt; Before you leave, you'll probably be prescribed a pain killer along with any other medication your doctor feels you need to take. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;</topHtml>

<!-- recov 2 - inpatient //-->

<topHtml secId="x" spotId="x">&lt;B class="largeviolet"&gt;F&lt;/B&gt;ollowing the procedure, you'll be moved then to a recovery area where you can relax until the sedation and anesthetic has worn off - At some point you will be moved to your room. While you're in the hospital, doctors and nurses will regularly check you - monitoring your progress following surgery.
&lt;p&gt; It's important that you realize your time in the hospital is an extension of the surgical procedure.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; While you're in the hospital, your medical team will continue to monitor your body's immediate reaction to the procedure just performed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; That means that your time in the hospital is not really for rest and recovery. And you should expect to have your movements restricted and even your sleep interrupted by nurses or other medical staff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The amount of time that you spend in the hospital will depend on your age, your health and whether or not any complications arise. Be assured that once your doctor feels that your condition is properly stabilized, you'll be allowed to leave. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Be sure to follow your doctor's advice and allow the full-recommended period of time before you return to your normal routine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Once you return home, you will be responsible to keeping the dressing intact and clean. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; As with all surgery, you should be alert for signs of infection near the incision - increased swelling, redness, bleeding or other discharge. Your doctor may advise you to be on the alert for other symptoms as well. If you experience any unusual symptoms, report them to your doctor right away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; You may also notice some bruising in the general area of the incision. The discoloration may be extensive - but as with any bruise, it should heal on it's own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Before you leave, you'll be given discharge guidelines which may include diet, medication, work and other activity restrictions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;</midHtml>

&lt;p&gt; This program has been designed to help you to understand a surgical procedure and to empower you to be an active participant in your own care. We hope that you take the time to discuss alternative treatments with your doctor and that you learn as much as you can about your own particular medical situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; We also want to make sure that you understand all the risks of surgery and potential complications which can follow - no matter how unlikely they may be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; It's important that you understand exactly what the procedure entails - including the risks, benefits and alternative treatments - before you decide to proceed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Always remember that the final decision to go ahead or not is up to you. &lt;/p&gt;</botHtml>
