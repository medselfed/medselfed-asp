&lt;p&gt; Now let's talk in detail about the procedure your doctor has recommended. That particular recommendation was based on a number of factors: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;B&gt; &lt;li class="medviolet"&gt;the state of your health, &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/B&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; And remember, the final decision is up to you. No one can force you to undergo a surgical procedure against your will. &lt;/p&gt;

<topHtml secId="4" spotId="1">&lt;B class="largeviolet"&gt;O&lt;/B&gt;ver the course of the procedure, you'll be under the care of one or more nurses. Our job is to provide for your care and comfort - before, during and after surgery.
&lt;p&gt; On the day of surgery, it's important that you tell us how you're feeling. And we certainly want you and your family to feel completely free to ask us any questions at any time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Before the operation, your doctors will examine your medical history as well as your current physical condition. This is an important step because the results of that exam will help your medical team to make decisions about your care. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; So remember, it is very important that you give your doctor your complete medical history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Be sure to remember to &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;B&gt; &lt;li class="medred"&gt; report previous illnesses, &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/B&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

<!-- ANA Header ALL //-->
<topHtml secId="5" spotId="1">&lt;B class="largeviolet"&gt;M&lt;/B&gt;ost people understand that anesthesia is used to block the perception of pain - but anesthesia plays another, equally important role as well. Let me explain.
&lt;p&gt; Anesthesia allows your surgical team to control - and to monitor - a wide range of natural physiological reflexes. As you know, all surgery involves cutting small amounts of skin or other tissue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Your mind certainly knows the difference between a surgical incision and, for example, and an accidental cut. The problem is, that your body doesn't understand this difference. In fact, your body reacts pretty dramatically to anything it perceives to be a threat to your well-being. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Without anesthesia, a surgical incision would cause not only pain, but an increase in heart rate, changes in blood pressure and a whole host of other reflexive defense mechanisms which our bodies rely on for protection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; So it's important to realize that anesthesia is meant to calm and relax the mind and body in a general sense - not only to block pain but to control those natural defenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; It's for that reason that the anesthesia you receive will probably include a sedative - either to relax you or to put you to sleep altogether. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Today, surgeons and anesthesiologists have a wide range of options for keeping you comfortable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Pain is an alarm signal sensed by nerves and sent to the brain where it's interpreted and felt. All types of anesthesia work by interfering with the transmission or interpretation of that signal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;</topHtml>

<!-- ANA 0  Local (L) Bottom //-->
<botHtml secId="5">Why would your doctor recommend or choose one kind of anesthesia over another? It's a decision based on comfort, precisely where on your body your surgery will take place and your overall physical condition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; This procedure is usually considered to be a simple operation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In unusual cases, a patient may be given general anesthesia - in other words, you might be put to sleep. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; But most often, your doctor will simply administer a local anesthetic ... with one or more injections of an anesthetic drug directly into the tissue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The advantage of this kind anesthetic is that it allows you to remain awake, it has less impact on you and your body than general anesthesia does and you recover from it much more quickly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; If you've ever experienced any allergic reaction to anesthesia or to any other substance, be sure to let your surgeon or anesthesiologist know well beforehand. &lt;/p&gt;</botHtml>

&lt;p&gt; This particular surgical technique offers the surgeon a wide selection of anesthesia options. The particular anesthesia chosen will depend on personal preference -- both yours and your doctor's. In some cases, patients are given general anesthesia -- in other words, you might be put to sleep. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; But most often, your doctor and anesthesiologist will administer a local anesthetic, either by injecting an anesthetic drug directly around the operative field so that all the tissue layers are numb &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;</midHtml>

<botHtml secId="x">&lt;p&gt; A spinal is still considered to be a kind of local anesthesia in that you remain awake during surgery. It's extremely effective, but takes a little longer to wear off than does a more localized anesthesia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Whatever method of pain relief is chosen, the anesthesia will probably be accompanied by a calming intravenous sedative as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; If you've ever experienced any allergic reaction to anesthesia or to any other substance, be sure to let your surgeon or anesthesiologist know well beforehand. &lt;/p&gt;</botHtml>

<topHtml secId="x" spotId="x">&lt;B class="largeviolet"&gt;B&lt;/B&gt;ecause you've been scheduled for ambulatory - or outpatient surgery - you're responsible for taking certain precautions before you arrive. Specifically...
&lt;p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;B&gt; &lt;li class="medred"&gt; You must not have anything to eat or drink after midnight on the night before you arrive at the hospital. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/B&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;B&gt; &lt;li class="medred"&gt; Do not take any aspirin or other anti-inflammatory for 10 days before surgery. Occasionally these drugs can interfere with the blood's ability to clot and can actually increase the amount of bleeding during and after surgery. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/B&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;B&gt; &lt;li class="medred"&gt; If you're on any medication - including over the counter drugs - be sure to ask your doctor whether or not you can continue taking that medication. And if not, how far in advance of surgery you must stop. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/B&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;B&gt; &lt;li class="medred"&gt; Finally, you must also arrange for transportation to and from the place at which the procedure will be performed. Everyone reacts differently to even simple surgical procedures and there's no way you can predict how you'll be feeling after the procedure. So don't forget, following surgery, you will not be allowed to drive. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/B&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The nurse and anesthesiologist will be closely monitoring your comfort and progress. Remember, don't hesitate to ask any questions about any of the information that they've just provided. &lt;/p&gt;</topHtml>

&lt;p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;B&gt; &lt;li class="medred"&gt; Finally, you must be prepared to spend one or more nights in the hospital.

&lt;p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;B&gt; &lt;li class="medred"&gt; It's important that you not make any plans for activities in the days following surgery. After your time in the hospital, you will spend even more time recovering at home. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/B&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;B&gt; &lt;li class="medred"&gt; And it's impossible to predict with 100% certainty how long you'll be in the hospital or how long you'll have to take it easy at home. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/B&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

So don't forget, following surgery, you will not be allowed to drive. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/B&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The nurse and anesthesiologist will be closely monitoring your comfort and progress. Remember, don't hesitate to ask any questions about any of the information that they've just provided. &lt;/p&gt;</topHtml>

<procedureInfo secId="7" spotId="2" slideimage="/370/370-7-02b.gif" image="/370/370-7-02.gif">you will be asked to put on a surgical gown.</procedureInfo>
<procedureInfo secId="7" spotId="3" slideimage="/370/370-7-03b.gif" image="/370/370-7-03.gif">You may receive a sedative by mouth</procedureInfo>
<procedureInfo secId="7" spotId="4" slideimage="/370/370-7-04b.gif" image="/370/370-7-04.gif">and an intravenous line may be put in.</procedureInfo>
<procedureInfo secId="7" spotId="5" slideimage="/370/370-7-05b.gif" image="/370/370-7-05.gif">You will then be transferred to the operating table.</procedureInfo>
<procedureInfo secId="7" spotId="6" slideimage="/370/370-7-06b.gif" image="/370/370-7-06.gif">To begin, your leg and groin are swabbed with an antiseptic solution.</procedureInfo>
<procedureInfo secId="7" spotId="7" slideimage="/370/370-7-07b.gif" image="/370/370-7-07.gif">Then the doctor will make a small cut over the femoral artery in the upper part of the leg.</procedureInfo>
<procedureInfo secId="7" spotId="8" slideimage="/370/370-7-08b.gif" image="/370/370-7-08.gif">A special needle is then inserted into the artery itself.</procedureInfo>
<procedureInfo secId="7" spotId="9" slideimage="/370/370-7-09b.gif" image="/370/370-7-09.gif">Then a guide wire is carefully passed through the needle and gently pushed into the artery</procedureInfo>
<procedureInfo secId="7" spotId="10" slideimage="/370/370-7-10b.gif" image="/370/370-7-10.gif">and upwards towards your chest.</procedureInfo>
<procedureInfo secId="7" spotId="11" slideimage="/370/370-7-11b.gif" image="/370/370-7-11.gif">A narrow tube, called a catheter is threaded along the wire until it too has reached the coronary artery</procedureInfo>
<procedureInfo secId="7" spotId="12" slideimage="/370/370-7-12b.gif" image="/370/370-7-12.gif">Next, the doctor uses the catheter to inject a dye into the artery itself. The die shows up on a TV monitor and is used to pinpoint the exact location of the blocked area.</procedureInfo>
<procedureInfo secId="7" spotId="13" slideimage="/370/370-7-13b.gif" image="/370/370-7-13.gif">Once the restricted area has been identified, a thin wire is inserted into the catheter, and is guided all the way to the blocked area and then slightly beyond.</procedureInfo>
<procedureInfo secId="7" spotId="14" slideimage="/370/370-7-14b.gif" image="/370/370-7-14.gif">This wire acts as guide for the balloon catheter. It allows your doctor to position the deflated balloon precisely in the middle of the narrowest part of the coronary artery.</procedureInfo>
<procedureInfo secId="7" spotId="15" slideimage="/370/370-7-15b.gif" image="/370/370-7-15.gif">The balloon is briefly inflated. As it expands, it squeezes the plaque deposits against the wall of the artery. It also stretches the artery wall and enlarges the channel through which blood flows.</procedureInfo>
<procedureInfo secId="7" spotId="16" slideimage="/370/370-7-16b.gif" image="/370/370-7-16.gif">Your doctor will continue to inflate and deflate the balloon until normal blood flow has been restored.</procedureInfo>
<procedureInfo secId="7" spotId="17" slideimage="/370/370-7-17b.gif" image="/370/370-7-17.gif">The balloon catheter is then withdrawn and another balloon catheter is inserted. This balloon has the mesh stent tube wrapped around it.</procedureInfo>
<procedureInfo secId="7" spotId="18" slideimage="/370/370-7-18b.gif" image="/370/370-7-18.gif">Once this tube has been placed in the center of now widened area of the artery, the balloon is briefly inflated. The stent expands until it hugs the walls of the artery.</procedureInfo>
<procedureInfo secId="7" spotId="19" slideimage="/370/370-7-19b.gif" image="/370/370-7-19.gif">Finally, after a thorough investigation of the region, the catheters and guide wire are withdrawn and the stent remains permanently to provide support to the artery and to resist the buildup of plaque.</procedureInfo>
<procedureInfo secId="7" spotId="20" slideimage="/370/370-7-20b.gif" image="/370/370-7-20.gif">The dye that had been injected will break up and leave your body as waste.</procedureInfo>
<procedureInfo secId="7" spotId="21" slideimage="/370/370-7-21b.gif" image="/370/370-7-21.gif">Slight pressure is applied to the incision in your leg in order to prevent bleeding.</procedureInfo>

<topHtml secId="8" spotId="1">&lt;B class="largeviolet"&gt;F&lt;/B&gt;ollowing the procedure, you'll be moved then to a recovery area where you can relax until the sedation and anesthetic has worn off - and until the doctor is satisfied that you are fit to go home. Plan on spending several hours in recovery. Your doctor may be able to give you a more precise estimate prior to surgery.
&lt;p&gt; Before you leave, you'll probably be prescribed a pain killer along with any other medication your doctor feels you need to take. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;</topHtml>

<midHtml secId="8" spotId="15">&lt;p&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Once you return home, you will be responsible to keeping the dressing intact and clean. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; As with all surgery, you should be alert for signs of infection near the incision - increased swelling, redness, bleeding or other discharge. Your doctor may advise you to be on the alert for other symptoms as well. If you experience any unusual symptoms, report them to your doctor right away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; You may also notice some bruising in the general area of the incision. The discoloration may be extensive - but as with any bruise, it should heal on it's own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Before you leave, you'll be given discharge guidelines which may include diet, medication, work and other activity restrictions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; This program has been designed to help you to understand a surgical procedure and to empower you to be an active participant in your own care. We hope that you take the time to discuss alternative treatments with your doctor and that you learn as much as you can about your own particular medical situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; We also want to make sure that you understand all the risks of surgery and potential complications which can follow - no matter how unlikely they may be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; It's important that you understand exactly what the procedure entails - including the risks, benefits and alternative treatments - before you decide to proceed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Always remember that the final decision to go ahead or not is up to you. &lt;/p&gt;</botHtml>
